## About The Project


Child Card is added for each Card created. The Total field on the card is equal to the sum of the input field on the card and the total fields of the child cards.

- [x] Add Card

- [x] Total Area
- [x] Card Update
- [x] Card Delete
- [ ] When you update and delete the card, the total area does not change. 'UPDATE_CARD' and 'DELETE_CARD' should be updated.
